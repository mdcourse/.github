# Step-by-Step Molecular Simulations with Python

This is the repository of _Step-by-Step molecular simulation with Python_. The main website
can be accessed [from this page](https://mdcourse.github.io/), and the Python codes are
provided in [a dedicated repository](https://github.com/mdcourse/python-codes).

## Goal

By following _Step-by-Step Molecular Simulations with Python_, you will write a simple Python
code containing the most basic functionalities of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
simulations. The main goal is to help users understand the basics of molecular simulation
algorithms.

In a second part of the project, the scripts will be used for small scientific
projects. In particular, some of the earliest results obtained by molecular
simulations, including the pioneering works by Metropolis, Rosenbluth,
Wood, and Parker in the 50s, will be re-explored.
